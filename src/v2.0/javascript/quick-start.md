# Steps to getting started with Appbase

## Step 0: Get Appbase
Log in to <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span> [Appbase Dashboard](http://appbase.io/developer/), and create a new app.

## Step 1: Add the Appbase JS Library

Add Appbase library to your codebase and set the app credentials as they appear here.

```html
<script src="//cdn.appbase.io/latest/appbase.js">
</script>
```

```js
Appbase.credentials("aphrodite",
"4d8d0072580912343cd74a09015cd217");
```

> Note: You will want to change the parameters of the ``Appbase.credentials()`` method to your own app name, app secret combination, as seen in the [Dashboard](http://appbase.io/developer).

## Step 2: Creating Vertices

Now let's create two Appbase vertices under two different namespaces "user" and "tweets".

```js
var userRef = Appbase.ns("user").v("andy");
var tweetRef = Appbase
			   .ns("tweet").v(Appbase.uuid());
```

Namespaces are containers that do not hold actual data, but help with data logic separation. A "vertex" can only be created using a ns reference object.

> As seen here, vertex takes a "String" as an identifier. ``Appbase.uuid()`` is a handy way for creating a unique String id.

## Step 3: Storing some Data

A vertex can store data as a JSON object using the ``setData()`` method.

```js
userRef.setData({
    status: "sudo",
    location: "Belo Horizonte, Brazil"
});
tweetRef.setData({
    message: "Remember Red, hope is a good thing."
});
```

## Step 4: Creating a simple data model

Vertices can be connected via edges. Now let's add the ``tweetRef`` as an edge to the ``userRef`` vertex.

```js
userRef.setEdge('tweeted', tweetRef);
```
Now, the tweetRef vertex can also be accessed using the path /user/andy/tweeted. To retrieve a vertex reference at a given path, ``ns.v(path)`` is a handy method.

## Step 5: Retrieving data, in real-time! 

Appbase supports retrieval of objects using realtime streams. We will now add listeners, which return existing data stored, and keeps returning new data as it keeps changing. Similarly we will add a listener for retrieving edges on the vertex.

```js
userRef.on('properties',
function(error, ref, userSnap) {
    console.log(userSnap.properties().status);
    console.log(userSnap.properties().location);
});
userRef.on('edge_added',
function(error, outVertexRef, tweetSnap) {
    console.log(tweetSnap.properties().message);
});
```

## Step 6: Smart search

Appbase supports a full-text smart search, and you can enable it in two simple steps.

Enable the search by toggling the <i class="fa fa-eye-slash"></i> switch in your app's preferred namespace. If search is enabled, you should see this icon <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> next to the namespace.
Second and final step, use this code snippet on the enabled namespace and have a full-text search widget.

```js
Appbase.ns('tweet').search({text:'hello',
properties: ['message']}, function(err, array) {
    console.log(array);
})
```

## Further

If you are using Appbase from a Javascript client, you might want to use user authentications over secret. Checkout [here](/docs/authentications.html) for more.

As a next step, you should checkout the [Javascript API reference](/docs/js.html) for an in-depth usage guide.
